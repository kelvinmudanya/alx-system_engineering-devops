### Incident Report - Health System Software Patient Queue Issue
## Incident Summary:
Oh boy! We were caught. On 10-04-2023 at approximately 10:00 AM, our health system software experienced a critical issue that led to a sudden surge in patient queues. The incident lasted for 2 hoursðŸ¤¯. The root cause of the issue was a time mismatch between the system time and the computer time, resulting in a bug (500) that inaccurately processed patient queue data.

## Impact:
a) Patient Queue Backlog: The time mismatch bug caused patient queues to increase significantly, reaching a peak of 500 patients waiting for their turn. 

b) Staff Overload: We are really sorry!

c) Missed Appointments: Prolonged wait times caused by the incident led some patients to leave without receiving care, resulting in missed appointments and potential health risks.

Incident Response and Mitigation:
a) Issue Triage: The Incident Response Team promptly assessed the situation and identified the root cause as a time mismatch between the system time and the computer time. This allowed us to prioritize efforts effectively.
b) Immediate Fix: Our technical team implemented a temporary fix by synchronizing the system time with the computer time and updating the necessary software components. This allowed patient queues to decrease gradually.

c) Communication: We established clear communication channels to keep stakeholders informed about the incident and ongoing efforts to resolve it. Regular updates were provided through emails, memos, and announcements.

d) Monitoring and Testing: Enhanced monitoring and testing protocols were implemented alongside the temporary fix to proactively identify potential recurrences or related issues.

## Preventative Measures:
a) Time Synchronization: We will implement robust time synchronization mechanisms to ensure accurate processing of patient queue data.
b) Regular Audits and Maintenance: Routine auditing and maintenance will be conducted to proactively identify and address any potential time-related issues.

c) Disaster Recovery Planning: Time synchronization considerations will be incorporated into our comprehensive disaster recovery plan, including backup systems and contingency measures.

d) Training and Awareness: Additional training and awareness programs will be provided to staff, emphasizing the importance of time synchronization in patient queue management.

## Conclusion:
We deeply regret the inconvenience caused by this incident and assure you that we are committed to improving the stability and performance of our health system software. We understand the critical importance of seamless patient care and are taking necessary steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.
